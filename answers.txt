1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
gitignore files specify the files which are a part of the project that the git should ignore. This list of files does not include the files which have been already tracked by git. The contents of this file follow a pattern which tells git what files are to be excluded. gitignore file can also be tracked, as people in the same project might want to neglect the same file. 
A complete .gitignore file for java is suggested by GitHub as follows : 
#CompiledClassFile*.class
# Log file*.log
# BlueJ files*.ctxt
# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME).mtj.tmp/
# Package Files #*.jar*.war*.nar*.ear*.zip*.tar.gz*.rar
# virtual machine crash logs, see http://www.java.com/en/download/help/error_hotspot.xmlhs_err_pid*Reference :

2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
While developing a project, a branch to the master branch of a git repository may be created. This may be done to accommodate features or any other necessity that might require branching. The new branch can be merged with the master branch in different ways such as traditional merge and fast-forward etc. Fast-forward is when the branch has not diverged from master branch. Then the git just makes the master to point to the latest commit of the new branch.

3. Why should you have different branches?
While developing a project, a branch to the master branch of a git repository may be created. This may be done to accommodate features or any other necessity that might require branching. Branches help separate one context of the item being developed from another.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
Multiple git repositories can be created for a project. The number of repositories created may depend on the requirements of the project.
